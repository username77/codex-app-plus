# Codex App Plus

[简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

Codex App Plus is an enhanced Windows desktop client for Codex, built with `React + TypeScript + Vite + Tauri 2`.

## Key Improvements Over Official Client

- **Optimized Memory Management**: Fixed memory leaks caused by MCP process lifecycle issues, preventing unloadable child processes
- **Enhanced Process Supervision**: Improved child process management for better stability and resource cleanup
- **Additional Features**: Integrated useful capabilities inspired by [CodexMonitor](https://github.com/Dimillian/CodexMonitor)

## Core Features

- Multi-workspace and thread management
- Full conversation workflow with model selection, permission profiles, and slash commands
- Comprehensive settings management (MCP services, Git, environment, providers)
- Embedded terminal sessions with PTY support
- Git operations (stage, commit, push, branch management)
- Windows Sandbox integration
- Session timeline and protocol traffic inspection

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite
- Desktop: Tauri 2, Rust
- Terminal: xterm, portable PTY
- Protocol: Generated from official `codex app-server`

## Requirements
